## What is Rumbl

Rumbl is a sports prediction game inspired by last man standing. The concept is simple, you predict one team to win each gameweek and compete in leagues with your friends to win. The catch, you can't pick the same team twice. Make a wrong pick, and you're out! The last person standing is the winner.
